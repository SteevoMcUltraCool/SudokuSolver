    <h1>Tips And Tricks To Solve Sodukus</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Soduku Solver implements basic and intermediate sokoku-solving methods. While
            programming this algorithm, I decided to implement the same step-by-step reasoning I attempt While
            solving sudokus. While this solver cannot solve everything, it's great at applying the following strategies
            and explaining them in a human-readable way.

        <h2>Sudoku Rules</h2>
        <p>
            A sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid. The grid has 9 rows, 9 columns, and nine 3x3 sections (or subgrids).
            You win the game by arranging the numbers 1->9 so that no row, column or subgrid has any duplicates (meaning they each conain 1->9 exactly once)
            There are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible winning Sudoku boards, so every challenge is unique, different, and exciting!

        <h2>Mark Potential Values</h2>
        <h4>Skill level: Beginner</h4>
        <p>
            It's important to utilize all the given information. Make sure you are aware which numbers can and cannot go in each tile.
            This is the first step my algorithm does every time it begins a puzzle.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bsec">
        <h2>Last Number Remaining</h2>
        <h4>Skill level: Beginner</h4>
        <p>
            Look for any tiles where only one number can go. If, like this Solver, you've flawlessly marked all potential values, these should stand out.
            Otherwise, look for boxes with 8 different numbers in it's corresponding row, column, or section- the number that isn't there goes into that box!
            <br>REMEMBER: every time you fill in a box, make sure to update everything around it!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bsec">
        <h2>Last Cell Remaining In Grid</h2>
        <h4>Skill level: Beginner</h4>
        <p>
            Look at each subgrid one at a time. Keep track of which numbers can go where. If there is only one available
            spot where a particular number can go, then you know that number must go there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bsec">
        <h2>Last Cell Remaining In Row / Column</h2>
        <h4>Skill level: Beginner</h4>
        <p>
            Similar to the last strategy, look at each row and column one at a time. Keep track of which numbers can go where. If there is only one available
            spot where a particular number can go, then you know that number must go there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bsec">
        <h2>Double Elimination In Grid</h2>
        <h4>Skill level: intermediate</h4>
        <p>
            Look at all the boxes in a subgrid. See if there is only 2 where a pair of numbers can go. This may be a little tricky to spot.
            However, if those boxes are also both in the same row and column, you can eleminate those numbers as a choice for that row / column aswell!
        </p>
